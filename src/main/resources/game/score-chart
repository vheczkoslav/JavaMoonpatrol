    Points are fairly straightforward. You get more points for shooting 
something than for jumping over it. Now that we've defined the entities 
we can show the points you get for taking them out.

--100 points for claws or saucers
--200 points for triads
--no points for any missiles flying enemies shoot at you
--500 point bonus for wiping out a group of 3 flying enemies
--800 points for a group of 4
--1000 for a group of 5. Note they must all appear at the same time and 
be of the same sort; 2 claws + 2 saucers just after are as tough as 4 
claws, but you don't get the bonus for them.

--no combos for jumping over 2 items although you do get points for both 
of them
--50 points for shooting a barrel(any size) rolling down a hill
--100 points for jumping over the barrel

--50 points for jumping over a small rock
--80 points for jumping over a regular rock
--100 points for jumping over a 2-part rock although if you shoot the 
half that doesn't look like a rock you get 80; shoot the half that does 
and jump, you get 20.
--100 points for shooting a rock, any size; big 2-part rocks get 200
--50 points for jumping over a small pit
--100 points for jumping over a small pit

--100 points for jumping over a tank
--200 points for shooting a tank
--no points for shooting the tank's missile

--500/800/1000 points for the car that sneaks up behind you, depending 
on how far away it is from you(farther=less points) but no points for 
jumping it
--300/500/800 points for shooting the poppers, 100 for jumping them
